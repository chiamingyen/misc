Leo 4.10 contains 9 months of intense work on Leo. Several very important
features are subtle; you could almost call them Easter Eggs, so please read
the following notes carefully.

The highlights of Leo 4.10:
--------------------------

* Dozens of new and improved features and commands, including...
  - Tab completion now shows all @command & @button nodes.
  - Leo tabs may be detached from the main window.
  - The Open With menu now works.
  - The leoInspect module answers questions about Python code.
  - Leo can highlight the pane containing the focus.
  - The bigdash plugin searches across multiple files.
  - Improved abbreviation capabilities.
  - Improved handling of URL's.
  - Improved editing of non-Leo files.
  - Improvements create "weightless" unit testing.
  - Improved Leo's home page.
* Easier installation on MacOS.
* Fixed almost 70 bugs.

The Easter Eggs
---------------

1. Tab completion now shows all @command & @button nodes.

Put all your common scripts in @command nodes in myLeoSettings.leo.
Typing <Alt-X>@c<Tab> will remind you of the names of these scripts.
You can execute the scripts by name without the "@command-" prefix.

2. Improved abbreviation capabilities.

Virtually any kind of abbreviation is possible. For example, ~a to Ã£.

3. Improved handling of URL's.

URL's can be used as links to other Leo outlines.

4 Weightless unit testing.

The mantra is edit, alt-4 (run-marked-unit-tests-externally), edit,
alt-4,... Several seemingly innocuous changes made this work without
"friction". The result is a remarkable increase in productivity.
